The Four Seasons of my Life -- An Autobiographical Poem

Birth: Spring's Awakening
(Rhyme Scheme: AABB, Rhythm: Iambic Tetrameter)

In spring’s embrace, a newborn cry,
Beneath the watchful gaze of sky.
A spark ignites, a life begins,
With dreams as vast as the winds.
  
Childhood: Summer's Play
(Rhyme Scheme: ABAB, Rhythm: Anapestic Tetrameter)

The days are long, the sun kisses the face,
Of a child whose steps are full of grace.
In fields of wonder, alone or with peers,
Discovering worlds, casting away fears.

Youth: Autumn's Shift
(Rhyme Scheme: ABBA, Rhythm: Trochaic Tetrameter)

Leaves turn gold, and whispers tell
Of a youth, in solitude, finds a shell.
Curious mind, heart so bold,
Challenges rise, truths unfold.

Adulthood: Winter's Tale
(Rhyme Scheme: Free Verse, Reflective Tone)

University halls, a life anew,
Challenges faced, perspectives grew.
At forty-four, a revelation, bright as day,
She sees her truth, sheds the old away.

With courage found, to a friend, she confides,
Embraces herself, with strides wide.
Transitioning, a journey of her own,
In her reflection, her truth finally shown.

Aging: The Twilight Glow
(Rhyme Scheme: Couplet, Rhythm: Iambic Pentameter)

Life's twilight years, in gentle glow,
Reflect on paths that made her grow.
With wisdom gained, and love’s embrace,
She lives each day with grace.

Death: The Final Verse
(Rhyme Scheme: ABCB, Reflective and Sober Tone)

Among the stars, a soul takes flight,
Leaving behind the longest night.
In hearts of those who shared her light,
Her story lives, burning bright.
